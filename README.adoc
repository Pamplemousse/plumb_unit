Plumb unit creates roles with testing framework or adds testing framework to existing role.

Place yourself in the root dir of your roles and launch :

 /path/to/plumb_unit/ansible_make_new_tested_role my_new_role

This will create a _roles_ directory in which the _my_new_role_ is created. The role itself only contains an empty tasks/main.yml and a tests directory.

To run tests for your role, you can then go to the tests directory and run them :

 cd roles/my_new_role/tests
 ./run_tests.sh
